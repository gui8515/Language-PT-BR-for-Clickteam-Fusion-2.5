<h1>Invaders Movement</h1>
<p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="main_content">
A movement to aid with the creation of games based on the classic Space Invaders. The movement controls the invaders,
making them change direction when reaching the edge of the screen, and even speeding them up as their numbers decrease.
</p>
<h2>Using the movement</h2>
<p class="main_content">
Apply the movement to the objects in the frame editor and configure the initial direction of the invaders, step size
and speed (how often they step) Note these properties are shared by all objects in the frame with the movement, it is only
required to set them once.
That's it! If you need to change the location of the point when the invaders change direction then insert the
movement's control extension into the frame and apply the appropriate settings. Note the automatic speed increase
setting is provided for newer users, in most cases you should use the control extension to set the movement speed
from the events as needed for your game.

<p class="main_content">
These properties are shared by all objects with Invaders movement in the current frame. Therefore changing the values in one
object will also change the values in all other objects with this movement.<br /><br />
	<b>Move at start:</b> Defines if the movement starts when the frame does or if the movement is initially paused.<br />
	<b>Automatically handle speed increase:</b> Select this option and the invaders will increase in speed as their number reduce.<br />
	<b>Initial Direction:</b> Will the invader move left or right first?<br />
	<b>Step Size X:</b> The amount in pixels the invaders hop each move in the x-axis.<br />
	<b>Step Size Y:</b> The amount in pixels the invaders hop each move in the y-axis.<br />
	<b>Speed:</b> How often will the invaders hop.<br />
	<b>Note</b>: due to a bug, the Invaders / Get Speed function of the Movement Controller object actually returns 101 - speed, 
	and you have to pass 101 - speed to Invaders / Set Speed.
